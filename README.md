# Enterprise Routing Lab

This is a comprehensive project that consolidates over 100+ labs from Cisco's CCNP ENARSI curriculum into a unified, simulated enterprise network. Designed for Cisco Modeling Labs (CML), this lab is ideal for practicing routing, security, monitoring, and wireless implementations in an enterprise setting.
