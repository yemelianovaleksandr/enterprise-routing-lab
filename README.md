# Enterprise Routing Lab (Cisco CCNP ENARSI)

This is a comprehensive project that consolidates over 100+ labs from Cisco's CCNP ENARSI curriculum into a unified, simulated enterprise network. Designed for Cisco Modeling Labs (CML), this lab is ideal for practicing routing, security, monitoring, and wireless implementations in an enterprise setting.

## ðŸ–§ Network Topology

Includes:
- Core and distribution switches
- Two branch routers with access switches
- DMVPN Hub & Spokes
- Central Firewall with NAT/ZBF
- Wireless LAN Controller + AP
- Monitoring server with Syslog, SNMP, NetFlow, NTP, AAA
- Full IPv4 & IPv6 routing: EIGRP, OSPFv2/v3, BGP, Redistribution, VRF, GRE, IPsec

## Technologies Covered

- âœ… Static & Dynamic Routing (EIGRP, OSPFv2/v3, BGP)
- âœ… Route Redistribution, Summarization, Path Manipulation
- âœ… VRF-Lite, GRE Tunnels, DMVPN Phases 1 & 3, IPsec VPNs
- âœ… NAT (Static/Dynamic), DHCP, HSRP, VRRP, GLBP
- âœ… VLANs, VTP, STP, EtherChannel, Inter-VLAN Routing
- âœ… IPv4/IPv6 ACLs, Route Maps, PBR, Prefix Lists
- âœ… ZBF (Zone-Based Firewall), CoPP, uRPF, Secure SSH
- âœ… AAA (RADIUS), Syslog, SNMP, IP SLA, NetFlow
- âœ… Wireless: WLC with WPA2 Enterprise, AP registration
